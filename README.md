Project presentation

This project has the principal objective of learning how to structure a .NET API using .NET 6 as the framework and C# as the programming language. It also aims to utilize SQL Server for database management and maintenance.

The project has an additional objective, which is to learn and implement Redis for data caching to optimize the application. It also aims to incorporate RabbitMQ for messaging control. For the architecture, I have chosen to use Domain-Driven Design, and for the design pattern, I have selected the Repository Pattern and concepts of SOLID.

The proposal for this project is to create a simple API for buying, selling, and holding shares.
